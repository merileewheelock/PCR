-pyserial

-find highest temp first (heated_lid) and add add 5 degrees
	-make headed_lid global variable

-stage 1: hot start
	-before cycle, run at 95 degrees (variable) for 3 minutes (variable)
	-single temp (variable) for set amount of time
	-happens once, no repeats
-stage 2: main stage
	-will repeat
	-be able to indicate how many times to repeat (the sequence will repeat)
	-inside stage, will be able to determine certain steps
	-set either 3 or 6 steps
	-2 parameters: termperature, amount of time
-stage 3: final extension
	-wrap up experiment
	-happens once, no repeats
	-set temperature, set amount of time
	-similar to hot start
	-all times, temps, and repeats will be variable

-stage 4: hold
	-set heated_lid to null
	-after experiment is run, hold temperature (cold?) until further notice
	-create counter, if counter reaches certain number, stop
	-may need to think of this


-touch screen compatible?
-no temps above 110 degrees
-create from template with default temperatures that user can adjust
-ability to save and store programs with text
